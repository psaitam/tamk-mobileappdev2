= React Native Exercises

Finished Snack Expo App (Drawer/Burger to navigate to "Exercise 5"):: https://snack.expo.dev/@psaitam/mobiledev-week5?platform=web

== Exercise 1: Permissions and Location

Request permission to access the device’s location and fetch the current coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Display the coordinates on the screen and add a button to refresh the location.

If permission is denied, show a clear message to the user.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `expo-location` library and the functions `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync` and `getCurrentPositionAsync`.
====


== Exercise 2: Async Storage – Saving Settings

Create a simple settings view where the user can, for example (it can be a weather app or any other app/context of your choice):

* Enter their favourite city (for example, for a weather app)
* Choose measurement units (`"metric"` or `"imperial"`)
* Save these values locally using AsyncStorage, and automatically load them when the app restarts.

The values should persist between app sessions.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` library and its `setItem` / `getItem` functions.
====


== Exercise 3: Camera and Permission

Create a simple camera screen that:

* Requests camera permission
* Displays the camera preview if permission is granted
* Allows the user to take a photo and shows a small preview of the captured image on the screen
* If the user does not grant permission, display a message and a way to request it again.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `expo-camera` library and the `useCameraPermissions` hook.
====


== Theory Task 2: Secure Data Storage (no coding)

Consider a situation where your app needs to store sensitive data, such as secret API keys, access tokens, or passwords.

Where and how should these values be stored securely?:: Sensitive data should be stored in secure sorage solutions. These are provided by the operating system. Usually this kind of storage is encrypted and protected the system itself, so apps can only access their own data.

Why should they not be saved in AsyncStorage or plain text files?:: AsyncStorage and plain text files do not provide encryption or other secure mechanisms. This makes it easy for other apps to access this data. This may causse security issues such as data leaks or unauthorized access.

What secure alternatives exist for React Native apps?:: There are multiple libraries which help with this. The easiest for expo apps might be expo-secure-store. This provides a simple API similar to the AsyncStorage API. There are also other libraries such as react-native-keychain or react-native-encrypted storage with more fine-grained control. Alternatively data can also be stored securely on external systems like backend servers.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Explore libraries like `expo-secure-store` or native *Keychain* / *Keystore* solutions.
