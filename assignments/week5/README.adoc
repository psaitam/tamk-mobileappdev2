= React Native Exercises

== Exercise 1: Permissions and Location

Request permission to access the device’s location and fetch the current coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Display the coordinates on the screen and add a button to refresh the location.

If permission is denied, show a clear message to the user.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `expo-location` library and the functions `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync` and `getCurrentPositionAsync`.
====


== Exercise 2: Async Storage – Saving Settings

Create a simple settings view where the user can, for example (it can be a weather app or any other app/context of your choice):

* Enter their favourite city (for example, for a weather app)
* Choose measurement units (`"metric"` or `"imperial"`)
* Save these values locally using AsyncStorage, and automatically load them when the app restarts.

The values should persist between app sessions.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` library and its `setItem` / `getItem` functions.
====


== Exercise 3: Camera and Permission

Create a simple camera screen that:

* Requests camera permission
* Displays the camera preview if permission is granted
* Allows the user to take a photo and shows a small preview of the captured image on the screen
* If the user does not grant permission, display a message and a way to request it again.

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Use the `expo-camera` library and the `useCameraPermissions` hook.
====


== Theory Task 2: Secure Data Storage (no coding)

Consider a situation where your app needs to store sensitive data, such as secret API keys, access tokens, or passwords.

* Where and how should these values be stored securely?
* Why should they not be saved in AsyncStorage or plain text files?
* What secure alternatives exist for React Native apps?

[NOTE]
====
*Hint:* Explore libraries like `expo-secure-store` or native *Keychain* / *Keystore* solutions.
