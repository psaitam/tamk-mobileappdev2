= Mobile Development Exercises

Finished Snack Expo App (Bottom navigation for Exercises):: https://snack.expo.dev/@psaitam/mobiledev-week4?platform=web

== Exercise 1 — Weather/REST Functionality (Fetching)

Implement functionality for last week’s weather forecast app (or any RESTful app).

* Fetch data from a weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
* Use the Fetch API with `async/await`.
* Add a text input for the city name. When the user taps a button, the app fetches and updates the screen with that city’s forecast.

== Exercise 2 — Getting Familiar with Device APIs

Build a level app in React Native (single screen).

* Use the device *Accelerometer* sensor.
* The app should change the background color depending on the device’s orientation.
* It should also indicate whether the device is level (for example, by displaying text like “Level” or changing the background to green when the device is flat).

=== Discussion Prompt (for next week)

*How does the OS supervise apps that access privacy-sensitive data (e.g., Location)?*  
What does this look like from the user’s perspective on Android (permissions, prompts, settings)?  
_(We’ll return to implementation details next time.)_

== Exercise 3 — Device-Specific Code

Explore platform-specific components in React Native.

Using the `Linking` module, choose two common intent actions from the list and implement them in your app:

* Make a phone call
* Open Maps to a specific location
* Send an email
* Open the web browser to a chosen URL
